**unmask** is a self-hosted bot management gateway for nginx and Apache.
It combines JA4 TLS fingerprinting with behavioral checks to distinguish
legitimate search / AI crawlers from disguised scrapers, with search-bot
preservation as the default posture.

## Features

- **Two-stage search-bot rescue** — UA list + official IP range double-check. Designed not to break Googlebot / GPTBot / ClaudeBot.
- **JA4 fingerprint** — Computed from the TLS handshake. Exposes headless Chromium / Puppeteer / Playwright through their UA disguise.
- **Behavioral CAPTCHA** — 5-axis score from mouseTrail / scroll / window-size. Harder to defeat than a plain checkbox or PoW.
